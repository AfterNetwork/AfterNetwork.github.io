  <h1>I shouldn't be fired.</h1>
  <p1>I mean, we are kids and teens, why fire someone, that can affect their feelings, how would you feel if you got fired from a MADE-UP currency, so why fire someone from something made-up. i mean, this is supposed to be a children's coding site, but in the forums, it has turned into 1 big mall in the reqyest forum, and my opinion is... We are kids! Also why have 4 founders and co-founders, that is unrealistic.</p>
